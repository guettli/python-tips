# GÃ¼ttli's opinionated Python Tips

# How to start?

My recommendation: Buy a book, switch off your PC. Read.

# Avoid

Native GUI (tkinter, gtk, Qt, ...)

# Testing

## PyTest
Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), and if you use Django, then use [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Reason: `assert a==b` is far more easy to read and write than `self.assertEqual(a, b)`.

`pytest -k keyword` is very handy. Just a keyword (or some characters) which are part of the filename or test-function, and only the functions containing this string will get called.

Execute test from your IDE. This way you can jump directly from the nice stacktrace to your beautiful code.

BTW, [pytest caching](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/cache.html) allows you the re-run only the failed tests.

## pytest-xdist

[pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist)

> The pytest-xdist plugin extends pytest with some unique test execution modes:
> 
> test run parallelization: if you have multiple CPUs or hosts you can use those for a combined test run. This allows to speed up development or to use special resources of remote machines.
> 
> --looponfail: run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess. After each run pytest waits until a file in your project changes and then re-runs the previously failing tests. This is repeated until all tests pass after which again a full run is performed.
> 
> Multi-Platform coverage: you can specify different Python interpreters or different platforms and run tests in parallel on all of them.

## Freezegun
[Freezegun](https://pypi.org/project/freezegun/)

> FreezeGun is a library that allows your Python tests to travel through time by mocking the datetime module.

```
@freeze_time("2012-01-14")
def test():
    assert datetime.datetime.now() == datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 14)
```

## Type Annotations

For me it feels much more productive to write tests, compared to write type annotations.

# Web Development

Use Django. Related [Django-Tips](//github.com/guettli/django-tips)

# Use Virtualenv

Virtualenv is a great tool to get isolated environments. It is very light-weighted and
I almost always use it.

I avoid to develop in Docker, virtual machines or Vagrant.

If a database is needed, then I usualy set it up on my local machine.

If the application needs a lot of servers (redis, solr, s3, ...) then I create 
containers to provide the service. Nevertheless during development 
my code runs directly on
my local machine, not inside a container or VM.

If the application is a web application (for example with Django), I use **http**
server (like `manage.py runserver`) and access the application this way. I don't
set up a https server for development. Serving the application via https is
only needed for the production environment, not for development.

This way I can easily run and debug my code.

I know that some IDEs have plugins to connect to vagrant/docker/ssh, but I avoid this
for daily development. I want a fast edit/test loop.

# Automatically format your code: Black

[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

> By using Black, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

> Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible. Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project youâ€™re reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.

# Unicode Symbols

Often you can avoid fancy SVG/PNG icons. You can use the unicode symbols: For example `\N{Lock}` ðŸ”’
